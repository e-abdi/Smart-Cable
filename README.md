# Updates
This tool was originally designed for simplifying sensor integration on gliders. Since I never managed to successfully run a functional check under pressure of the original idea which was a circuit inline a cable assembly, and ended up using the circuit inside the dry hull of gliders, I have started to rethink the design. Since the request for a similar type of device is increasing from the glider community, especially after the introduction of the Slocum Back Seat Driver, I have started to trying to find a suitable commercially available hardware that can be easily replace this platform. Hopefully more updates will follow soon! 
# Smart-Cable
Smart Cable is a cable assembly with a modular pressure tolerant electronics circuit embedded inline which can take care of any sensor integration need such as voltage regulation, protocol translation, data processing, storage and many more which traditionally often requires many months of engineering effort. The circuit consists of a base plate with the right connections to connect any variation of modules. the modules consist of processor module, protocol modules (RS-323, 485, 422, Ethernet, USB, CAN-bus) , power module and a variety of miscellaneous modules (ADC, memory, Real-time clock, etc.)
